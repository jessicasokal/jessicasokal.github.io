        "description": `When I was a freshman, my high school hosted a \"turn a poem into a video\" contest -- of which I submitted this video. In terms of technical skill,
            this video needs alooootttt of work -- the lighting is bad, the audio is bad, the pacing of the voiceover is pretentious; there are definetly a lot of things I would change
            if I were to redo something like this now. <br/><br/>
            That being said -- I think the overall style and visual storytelling I used was interesting and aged well, which is why I'd still like to show it here!
            <br/><br/>
            This wasn't a super popular competition, ultimately about ten entries total, but in the end, this video came in first,
            winning a congratulations over the intercom, before they continued with the regularly scheduled bus dismissals.`,

        "description": `In high school, I participated in VEX Robotics, a program that had students build robots for a specified game and compete against other teams with them. 
            In addition to physical competitions, they also had 'online challenges,' one of which was to create an animation of a new VEX game. For this video, 
            I taught myself how to use <a href='https://www.blender.org/' target='_blank'>Blender</a>, including how to design, move and texture objects. I also concieved of this competition idea, 
            and wrote the script for the voiceover. <br/><br/> Ultimately, this video came in second place out of about thirty entries, winning my program a $500 gift card.`,
